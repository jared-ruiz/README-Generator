## Weekly Reflection
---

The assignment this week was very rough for me. Using promises, modules, inquirer, etc, was a lot to take in and I feel like I definetly need more practice. The command line inputs reminded me of when I was learning C++ a few months back so that was some what familiar to me. I think the hardest part of this assignment was understanding exactly what objects were being used/created, and thinking more outside of the box in regards to interpolation. There were so many new approaches to solving these problems and It really broadened my view on the whole subject. It's becoming more and more apparent to me that 1 week is not enough for me to truly grasp these new subjects one hundred percent, but I'm planning to add more and more comments to my submissions, that way when I return back to these repos for help and guidance, I'll at least know where my mindset was. It's getting harder every week so here's to another.
